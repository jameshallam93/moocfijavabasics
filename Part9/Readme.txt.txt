Part 9 is focussed on Inheritance, Abstract Classes, Polymorphism and Interfaces.

Exercises 1 and 2 are a trivial introduction to inheritance and super constructors.
Exercise 3 involved creating a warehouse, productWarehouse and productWarehouseWithHistory classes, with each extending the last, and a ChangeHistory class to assist with the last of these.
Exercises 4 and 5 involved creating Boxes with different limitations (e.g the max weight or quantity) and all extending the class Box
Exercise 6 introduces Interfaces, and involved creating different Packable items that could be loaded into Boxes (Box was also implementing Packable).
Exercises 7-9 are trivial exercises introducing Polymorphism in function calls.
Exercise 10 is a simple demonstration of an online shop. A warehouse records stock info, a shopping cart creates and stores Item objects in itself, and a Store object acts as a user interface which updates both the cart and the warehouse as items are purchased.
Exercise 11 demonstrates more use of interfaces.
Exercise 12 ties all the concepts using an abstract class Animal, and an interface NoiseCapable.
