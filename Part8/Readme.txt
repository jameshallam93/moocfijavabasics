This is the first section of the second part of the course (Parts 1-7 = Part 1, Parts 8-14  = part 2).

The first 6 exercises are taken from various sections of part 1 and can be considered refresher exercises to ensure knowledge of all concepts covered previously.
Exercises 7-15 deal with HashMaps, HashCodes, overriding object methods (equals etc.), Hashmaps including ArrayLists as values, and throughout this part of the course I began to learn about the advantages of different data structure types (i.e. HashMaps being very quick to search, not requiring iterations over the whole list).
