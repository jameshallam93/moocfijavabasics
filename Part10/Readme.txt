Part 10 focusses on the concepts of creating streams from collections and manipulating data streams, using lambda expressions in programs, how to order objects using the java comparable interface, as well as some other useful techniques.

From here on out, I will be uploading exercises solely using git commands in the console, and will look into further git concepts such as rebasing.

I will update this documentation on completion of all the exercises.
