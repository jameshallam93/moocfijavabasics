Part 11 looks at class diagrams, digs deeper into packages and imports, explains how to throw and handle exceptions and looks at reading and saving data to a file.

Exercises 1-7 are all constructed from Class diagrams and provided a way of practicing how to read and implement programs from these diagrams.

Exercises 8 and 9 look at how to manage packages, and when you should be using packages to simplify programs

Exercise 10 is a basic text-based Airport Control system, with two separate UI's, one for Asset Management and one for Flight information. All data is stored in FlightControl class in the logic package in hashmaps, Places, planes and flights are in the domain package, and the User interfaces are in the ui package.

Exercise 11 introduces parameter validation through declaring illegal argument exceptions

Exercise 12 digs a little deeper into parameter validation by imagining different sensors all implementing an overarching sensor interface.

Exercise 13 is focussed on reading and writing data to files, in the form of a dictionary which can translate in both directions (i.e. finnish-> english, english -> finnish).
