All exercises from the Helsinki University Java basics 1 and 2 course


Around a month ago I started working through a course developed by Helsinki University. A two part course, it has easily been the most enlightening process in teaching me the fundamentals of programming so far. I am currently on part 6/7 of part 1, and have decided to upload all the excercises that I have completed so far. I intend to go through and provide a small amount of documentation for each one, to make clear the purpose of the program, and the concepts I learnt whilst completing them.

I also intend from now on to upload all completed exercises after I finish each sub-section, so that I can create the documentation whilst it is still fresh in my mind, and to cement the knowledge I have gained.

I hope that this will embed knowledge of Github at the same time, as well as begin to build my portfolio for prospective employers for when I start to search for jobs.

Prior to starting this course, I had delved into Python in a fairly unstructured way - starting by reading Automate the boring stuff, I gained a basic understanding of common concepts and syntax, but quickly found myself out of my depth when I tried to apply these concepts whilst making more complex programs. On completing this course, I intend to revisit Python and attempt to translate the concepts I have learned here to the syntax of Python. After this, I want to focus on learning JavaScript due to it being a front end language, and eventually work up to creating a web app using React, as it seems to be at the forefront of what is possible for front end languages. Ideally, I will use Python to create the backend, and hope to link these up at some stage.
